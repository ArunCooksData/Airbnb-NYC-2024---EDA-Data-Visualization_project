# 📌 Airbnb NYC 2024 - EDA & Data Visualization

## 🏡 Overview
This project dives deep into **Airbnb listings in New York City (2024)** using **Python** to uncover key insights through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization**. The goal is to analyze pricing trends, neighborhood distribution, and room availability to help **hosts optimize their listings** and **travelers find better deals**.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Features
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and type conversions.  
✅ **Feature Engineering** – Creating new insights such as **price per bed** for better analysis.  
✅ **Price Distribution & Outlier Analysis** – Identifying unusual pricing patterns.  
✅ **Neighborhood & Room Type Analysis** – Exploring price variations across boroughs.  
✅ **Geo-Spatial Visualizations** – Mapping Airbnb locations using **latitude & longitude**.  
✅ **Correlation Heatmaps & Trend Analysis** – Understanding relationships between key factors.  
✅ **Interactive Visualizations** – Using **Matplotlib & Seaborn** to create impactful charts.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊 (Data Cleaning & Processing)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈 (Data Visualization)  
- **Geospatial Analysis** 🗺️ (Mapping listings across NYC)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes **Airbnb listings from NYC for 2024** with details such as:  
📌 Listing ID, Host Name, Neighborhood, Room Type, Price, Availability, Reviews, etc.

## 🏙️ Key Findings
🔹 **Manhattan** has the highest Airbnb prices, while **Bronx & Queens** offer budget-friendly stays.  
🔹 Private rooms are cheaper, but entire apartments dominate the market.  
🔹 Some extreme **outliers** were found in pricing (over $10,000 per night).  
🔹 Hosts with multiple listings have different pricing strategies.  
🔹 Availability varies greatly based on location & seasonality.

## 📌 Visualizations
📌 **Price Distribution & Outliers** – Boxplots & Histograms  
📌 **Neighborhood Comparisons** – Bar Charts & Pie Charts  
📌 **Geo-Spatial Analysis** – Scatter Maps of Listings
